## About this blog

I started this blog to document and share my thoughts and past experiences. It will contain certain situations I faced in the past, problems I solved, and consequences of the decisions I took, but also some other theoretical problems that I am interested in learning more about and want to share what I've researched. The language I'm going to use will be always very informal and trying to use as many images and analogies as I can, to make it easy for everybody to understand. Together with this blog, there is also a [GitHub](https://github.com/diocorrea) account where I will be creating several projects to exemplify concrete implementations and to make it visible some of the concepts I'll be talking about.

There are always many ways to solve problems and nobody has to agree with my way of thinking. Not just that, I would love to have a discussion and learn different points of view, this is what excites me more about this career! Saying that I also don't intend to be right all the time, but just open this forum to share my point of view, which can pretty much change at any point.

Lastly, if you have any topic ideas that you think I should cover please reach out to me in any of my contacts.
